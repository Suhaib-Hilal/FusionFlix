### Pull Requests

We welcome contributions! If you'd like to make a significant change, please follow these steps:

2. Make your changes and ensure that tests and existing functionality are not broken.
3. Create a clear and descriptive pull request with details about your changes.

## Code Style

We value clean and maintainable code. To ensure consistency across the project, please follow the existing code style and formatting conventions. If your contribution involves code changes, make sure your code adheres to the project's style.

### 1. Code Formatting

- Use a consistent and readable code style.
- Indentation: Use spaces (not tabs) for indentation. Use two spaces for each level of indentation.
- Line Length: Limit lines to 80 characters to ensure readability.
- Use consistent naming conventions for variables, functions, and classes.

### 2. Linting

- Run a linter on your code before submitting a pull request to catch common issues.
- Include any necessary configuration files for the recommended linter in the project.

### 3. Comments

- Add clear and concise comments to explain complex sections of code.
- Ensure that comments are kept up-to-date with code changes.

### 4. Documentation

- Provide comprehensive documentation for new features or changes.
- Keep inline code comments focused on explaining why, not what (the code itself should be self-explanatory).

### 5. Tests

- Write unit tests for new features or bug fixes.
- Ensure that existing tests pass before submitting a pull request.
- If applicable, include test cases that cover edge cases and potential issues.

### 6. Git Workflow

- Create a new branch for each feature or bug fix.
- Make sure your branch is up-to-date with the latest changes from the main branch before submitting a pull request.
- Use clear and descriptive commit messages.

### 7. Versioning

- Follow semantic versioning (SemVer) for version numbers.
- Update the `CHANGELOG.md` file with details of any changes made.

By following these code style guidelines, we can maintain a clean and consistent codebase that is easy to understand and contribute to.
